What did you do in this lab?
part0: get used with git and MPLAB X, learn how to use git to upload and update files, build and debug in MPLAB X.
part1: get deeper on debuting, learn how to check the output and variables, form the code, check history, and use pause in the middle of the code.
part2: use printf() function to make a temperature conversation table.
part3: use Oled functions to print out "Hello World!" to the OLED on UNO32 board.

What mistakes did you make, and how did you identify and solve them?
When trying to format the temperature conversation table to meet the specific width and padded, I use "-" instead of "0". My output looks different from the output on Lab document, so I search some more detailed information about printf function, and then, solved the problem.

Do you have any feedback for us about this lab?
The Lab document is very clear, detailed and step by step! It helps me a lot!
