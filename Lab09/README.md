An overview of the BattleBoats system. Describe how it works, as you understand it.
What worked well? What didn’t? Describe at least one testing strategy you found effective.
What did you learn from this lab?
What did you like about this lab? What would you change about this lab?

We write out a player together who play the game with an AI. Agent is to run the whole game, negotiation is to decide who go first, message is to delivery information between the players, and field is to determine every player's current situation. The pseudocode and the logic graph of the state machine in the lab manual really helped me a lot in when writing the code. The testing strategy I found really helpful is to add printf under the part that suspect is wrong. I also found that the stack window in MPLAB is also really helpful. It can locate our bug with accurate line sometimes. I got more skillful on using multiple pointers, structs, enums, and how to use all of them together. I like this lab that it is really interesting. When I heard that we are writing a lab that is something about AI, I got really exciting about this. If I can change this lab, maybe I would add a counting down time limit.
