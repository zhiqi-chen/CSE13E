In the next section you should provide a summary of the lab in your own words. Highlight what you thought were the important aspects of the lab. If these differ from how the lab manual presents things, make a note of that.

This lab is to make a mini game that can go to different directions and going into rooms to have a little adventure. The lab manual go through many details about this lab. However, I couldn't figure out what this lab want me to do, what exactly the output should be. It would be really nice to have an example output that we can follow with.


The following section should describe your approach to the lab. What was your general approach to the lab? Did you read the manual first or what were your first steps? What went wrong as you worked through it? What worked well? How would you approach this lab differently if you were to do it again? Did you work with anyone else in the class? How did you work with them and what did you find helpful/unhelpful?

Yes, I did read the lab manual first, but I am really confused at first. Then I went to two lab sections and went through the pseudocode that given by the TAs during section time. The pseudocode really help me understand what we suppose to do in this lab. If I could start this lab again, I would read the lab manual more carefully and patiently for a few more times before starting the code, because I found out that I missed the Room description files part which is really important and waste me lots of time because of missing it. 


The final section should describe the results of you implementing the lab. How did it end up finally? How many hours did you end up spending on it? What'd you like about it? What did you dislike? Was this a worthwhile lab? Do you have any suggestions for altering it to make it better? What were the hardest parts of it? Did the point distribution for the grading seem appropriate? Did the lab manual cover the material in enough detail to start you off? Did examples or discussions during class help your understanding of this lab or would more teaching on the concepts in this lab help?

Following the pseudocode and write the code out didn't't cost me too many of times. The most of time is using in starting this lab and debugging at the end. The directory bug of RoomFiles really prevent me finishing this lab. Then I found out that we need to use the directory of our own laptop and it may exceeds 50 bytes and printing out "Abort Trap: 6" which I have no idea what it means and where is this bug. This is I think the hardest part for me. If the lab manual can as detailed as we had for the previous labs would be really nice! And the point distribution for the grading seem reasonable. Also, the examples and discussions during class does help me to better understand this lab.


**** To submit, I put the directory of RoomFiles that given in lab manual instead of the directory in my own laptop. ****
