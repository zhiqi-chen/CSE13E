Report the results of the timing experiment in sort.c. Which was faster, SelectionSort() or InsertionSort()? Explain why. Was this what you expected?

First NOP: 211.76ms
Second NOP: 48.397ms
Third NOP: 682.32ms
Forth NOP: 24.476ms
So, the SelectionSort is definitely faster, because SelectionSort only needs to swap data, but InsertionSort needs to remove and insert again.

In the next section you should provide a summary of the lab in your own words. Highlight what you thought were the important aspects of the lab. If these differ from how the lab manual presents things, make a note of that.

The main lab is to write the function for linked list to move around the items in list, and to write the two different sorting function use two different method. My expectation is exactly same as how the lab manual presents.


The following section should describe your approach to the lab. What was your general approach to the lab? Did you read the manual first or what were your first steps? What went wrong as you worked through it? What worked well? How would you approach this lab differently if you were to do it again? How did you work with other students in the class and what did you find helpful/unhelpful?

I first watch the record from last week, and the go through the lab manual. I was a little confused about how to apply pointer into linked list, but after I go through the lecture notes about the pointer again, it becomes easier. If I were to do it again, I would understand pointer better before starting the lab.


The final section should describe the results of you implementing the lab. How did it end up finally? How many hours did you end up spending on it? What'd you like about it? What did you dislike? Was this a worthwhile lab? Do you have any suggestions for altering it to make it better? What were the hardest parts of it? Did the points distribution for the grading seem appropriate? Did the lab manual cover the material in enough detail to start you off? Did examples or discussions during class help your understand this lab or would more teaching on the concepts in this lab help?

I finished the functions of linked list very fast when watching the recorded class video. And I finish up the sorting function also not long following the pseudocode. However, when I start debugging my code, many problem starts come out. Some of my function is losing some important parts, and some of my code has significantly type error. I go through my code really carefully again like rewriting them. Then I fix them one by one slowly. The points distribution for the grading seem very reasonable. Going through linked test and the pseudocode in lab manual really really help me a lot. The example of SelectionSort and InsertionSort in action also help to understand the pseudocode.
