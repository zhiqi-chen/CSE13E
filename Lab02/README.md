What happens if the line “scanf(" ");” executes? Why?
The program will ask the users to enter a required type of input, and the input can be stored. The function will returns the number of items successfully converted and assigned. 
Because the function is to scan formatted text from stdin.

In this lab, we forbid you from using printf() or scanf() inside of certain
functions. Explain why a rule like this is useful.
Because forbidding using printf() and scanf() inside the functions can help us to separated unary operators and binary operators before calling the functions.


How long did this lab take you? Was it harder or easier than you expected?
It took me about three days (not the whole day). The main logic of the code is not hard, but the branches are more detailed and harder than I expected.
