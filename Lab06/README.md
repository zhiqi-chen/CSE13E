In the next section you should provide a summary of the lab in your own words. Highlight what you thought were the important aspects of the lab. If these differ from how the lab manual presents things, make a note of that.

This lab is to write the function that work with microcontrollers to output the specific LED patterns and change the LED pattern by moving the buttons up and down. The lab need to use some of the hardware on the I/O Shield: the OLED, potentiometer, switches, buttons, and LEDs. It's same as how the lab manual presents things.


The following section should describe your approach to the lab. What was your general approach to the lab? Did you read the manual first or what were your first steps? What went wrong as you worked through it? What worked well? How would you approach this lab differently if you were to do it again? How did you work with other students in the class and what did you find helpful/unhelpful?

Yes, I did read the lab manual first. However, when I tried to start writing codes, I get a little confused because I didn't go through the .h files first. I would definitely go through the .h files first, because they have many define and some specific function and values that we need to use in our code. After figuring out how to deal with the .h files, the pseudocode really helped me a lot on writing out the code.


The final section should describe the results of you implementing the lab. How did it end up finally? How many hours did you end up spending on it? What'd you like about it? What did you dislike? Was this a worthwhile lab? Do you have any suggestions for altering it to make it better? What were the hardest parts of it? Did the points distribution for the grading seem appropriate? Did the lab manual cover the material in enough detail to start you off? Did examples or discussions during class help you understand this lab or would more teaching on the concepts in this lab help?

The lab ends up really nice. I carefully following the pseudocode and the logic of it, my code doesn't have too many bugs to fix, which is really nice. This lab has many parts, so I used relative more times than the previous labs. I used four whole day and half to finish the lab. The hardest part for me is to understand what is the goal of this lab, the logic of the whole lab, and to draw out a whole pattern of each functions to make them work together when I first started the lab. The points distribution for the grading seem very reasonable. And the lab manual definitely cover enough detail, it's just me need some time to digest these whole lots of details and organize for it. The discussion during class does help, but it would be better if we can going through some example code. The example codes make more sense than the function definitions for me, because the definitions are too abstract, but I don't know about how others feel, it's just my personal feeling.
