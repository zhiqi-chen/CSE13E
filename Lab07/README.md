In the next section you should provide a summary of the lab in your own words. Highlight what you thought were the important aspects of the lab. If these differ from how the lab
manual presents things, make a note of that.

This lab display an oven on OLED. The users can choose different mode, and set cook time and temperature. Also, the Led will turn off one by one as the time counting down. I think the most important part is to use the button and adc to set the mode, time and temperature.


The subsequent section should describe your approach to the lab. What was your general approach to the lab? Did you read the manual first or what were your first steps? What went wrong as you worked through it? What worked well? How would you approach this lab differently if you were to do it again? How did you work with other students in the class and what did you find helpful/unhelpful?

Yes, I read the lab manual only once like previous times, but I found out that I can not understand it really well like before. Therefore, I read the the lab manual for multiple times and take many notes. There is many detailed requirement that I need to mark down when coding. The whole main logic then came out really quick. If I could start again, I wouldn't try to start this lab when only read this lab manual once. Since the lab section and office hour time are all late at midnight in China. I asked other students about what have been taught during sections, and I found out that the pseudocode that Has go through really helped me. 


The final section should describe the results of you implementing the lab. How did it end up finally? How many hours did you end up spending on it? What'd you like about it? What did you dislike? Was this a worthwhile lab? Do you have any suggestions for altering it to make it better? What were the hardest parts of it? Did the points distribution for the grading seem appropriate? Did the lab manual cover the material in enough detail to start you off? Did examples or discussions during class help your understanding this lab or would more teaching on the concepts in this lab help?

After I finish my coding, debugging is really hard for me, because we don't know which part exactly goes wrong and since this is a long lab, going through each parts again and again to fix the bug took me lots of time. Although it's hard and huge, this lab is the most interesting one that I have ever wrote. And the points distribution for the grading seem very reasonable. The lab manual really covers lots of thing, and it is very detailed. The FSM logic figure really helped me a lot! I don't know if I can figure out this lab without that. I wonder why don't we have autogravder this time, since it helped me a lot to locate my bug in previous labs.
