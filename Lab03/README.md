Provide a summary of the lab in your own words. Highlight what you thought were the important aspects of the lab. If these differ from how the lab manual presents things, make a note of that.

We write multiple functions for the calculation of matrixs. I though how to apply the functions and some of the mathematic definition about matrix calculation is important. It's same as the lab manual presents things. The lab manual give very detailed information about each function.


Describe your approach to the lab. What went wrong as you worked through it? What worked well? How would you approach this lab differently if you were to do it again? Did you work with anyone else in the class? How did you work with them and what did you find helpful/unhelpful?

Sub matrix is the hardest function in this lab, others all went very well by following the lab instruction and the equation that given. Yes, I discussed with someone else in our class about only the Sub matrix function, because he went to lab section and we got the same problem in this function. The lab section is really helpful, he told me what the TA taught him, so that I can fix my bug nicely.


Give us some feedback. How many hours did you end up spending on it? What'd you like about it? What did you dislike? Was this a worthwhile lab? Do you have any suggestions for altering it to make it better? What were the hardest parts of it? Did the points distribution for the grading seem appropriate? Did the lab manual cover the material in enough detail to start you off? Did examples or discussions during class help you understand this lab or would more teaching on the concepts in this lab help?

The mathematic definition is very detailed and help me a lot in this lab. The hardest part is Sub matrix as I mentioned in the previous question. I know writing unit test is very important, but it is a little less interesting than writing functional code for me. The points distribution for the grading seem really reasonable, it is just divided into equal pieces, looks very fair. The lab manual is very detailed in every function. The concepts in class also helped me a lot in the lab. It's the basic concepts for the lab.
