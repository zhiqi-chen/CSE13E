In the next section you should provide a summary of the lab in your own words. Highlight what you thought were the important aspects of the lab. If these differ from how the lab manual presents things, make a note of that.

This lab is to make a rpn calculator program by using stacks, pointers, and some other string functions. The main logic things are the operations and errors. The lab manual mainly go through the knowledge points and some of the functions. It gives a very good idea about how the calculator should look like.


The following section should describe your approach to the lab. What was your general approach to the lab? Did you read the manual first or what were your first steps? What went wrong as you worked through it? What worked well? How would you approach this lab differently if you were to do it again? How did you work with other students in the class and what did you find helpful/unhelpful?

I read the lab manual first, and then go through the lecture notes really quick. After that, I start thinking about the general framework of my code. Then I start writing from the easier functions, first stack then rpn. Evaluation is harder than the other functions, because it has many logics in it. It is easy to make a mess and miss something important. Therefore, I check the pseudocode that one of the TAs go through in the lab section and see what did I miss. After understanding the logic of his pseudocode, everything becomes much clearer. If I was to do it again, I would write my pseudocode first before I start.
 

The final section should describe the results of you implementing the lab. How did it end up finally? How many hours did you end up spending on it? What'd you like about it? What did you dislike? Was this a worthwhile lab? Do you have any suggestions for altering it to make it better? What were the hardest parts of it? Did the points distribution for the grading seem appropriate? Did the lab manual cover the material in enough detail to start you off? Did examples or discussions during class help you understand this lab or would more teaching on the concepts in this lab help?

It did end up really nice and I have learnt a lot. This lab helps me to put the knowledge that I learnt in class into application, which is also the most thing that I like most about this lab. I spent four whole days in this lab. If the lab manual can go through the errors and some logic about the lab would be really nice. The hardest part is the evaluate function. The points distribution for the grading seem very reasonable. The discussion during the class helped me a lot in this lab. After watching the recording, I already have some ideas in my mind.
